### 29th November 2017

We completed a retrospective and have identified the following areas that require work. Each of these has been assigned an owner. That owner is responsible for setting up meetings to discuss the item, working with everone required in order to get it resolved. They are not (necessarily) the person to perform any work required. There should be an Issue created to track the progress of item and the link should appear in the table below:
